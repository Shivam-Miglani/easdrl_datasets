Cook the rice the day before or use leftover rice in the refrigerator
The important thing to remember is not to heat up the rice, but keep it cold
In a bowl, add 1 tablespoon of oil to rice
Use spoon or your hands to work the oil into the rice, evenly coating the rice
Transfer the rice to a colander and drain
Combine eggs and salt in a small bowl and gently whisk until blended
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok
Add whisked eggs and cumin seeds to wok
Stir frequently, working the eggs to a scramble
Heat the remaining oil in the wok
If desired, you can recycle some of the oil that drained from the rice
Add the garlic and onion to the wok
Stir-fry together over high heat of about 5 minutes or until the onion looks transparent, but is not soft
Add the rice, eggs, soy sauce, chili sauce, vinegar and celery
Mix together, continuing to stir-fry over high heat for 1-2 minutes while stirring frequently
Spoon onto a plate and serve
